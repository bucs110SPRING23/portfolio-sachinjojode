# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
This program creates a bear using circles and ovals. I used functions for most parts of the program and was able to simplify much if it because of the functions.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
Everything in the program is working, however, in the future I want to look more into the oval function because there are still some small tweaks that can be made to make it easier to use.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
I used stack overflow and geeks for geeks website in order to figure out how to make an ellipse with the turtle module.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
